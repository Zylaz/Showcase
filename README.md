# Showcase
This is Marcin Ostrowski's showcase repository. Most of the projects use what I learned during my time at university as a base on which I then expand and experiment. Each section describes projects that I am currently working on or finished and can showcase them. Contact: marcinmate336@gmail.com
## Python
This is the language I feel most comfortable with. My master's is based on implementing self wrapper algorithm in Python and most of the projects I did were in Python. Finished projects include explanatory data analysis (EDA folder), model creation and hyperparameter tuning, and, the problem I am most interested in, label disproportion in semi-supervised learning.
## R 
R is a language that I am familiar with, quite well, but I do think it feels more archaic and less accessible for users without statistical knowledge than Python. That being said, it can be a great tool to use statistical tests. In this folder, I showcase some of the topics that interest me such as survival analysis, data exploration, creating models, and more.
## SQL
I am still learning SQL and I would say that my experience with it is quite basic. That being said, I do think that it is a great tool that everyone working with data should know. Because of that, I am eager to learn more about it. The projects in this folder are based on a course I completed at Warsaw University of Technology.  
## Excel and MSOffice
I worked with the whole MSOffice package a lot previous to going to university. Then, we exchanged Excel for Python and R, PowerPoint for LateX, etc. I do not post any completed projects here but I gained some experience with advanced Excel in a course Actuarial Modeling which focused on Excel.
